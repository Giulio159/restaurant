     <p>honestly this is the best italian restaurant abroad I've ever eaen to.	the pizza it's just like an italian
     one, and every dish is tasteful! trus me, i'm an Italian tourist that came here in vancouver for a 
couple weeks. i've travelled a lot so i can say tha his is just like the food you can find in Italy.
     Plus the chefs are all Italians! Complimenti!!!</p>
 
	

    <li><h3>-nice</h3></li>
	<p>this is a really good restaurant. i thisnk is better if you dine here rather than have lunch, because
	there are italian desserts. my favourite right ow is the tiamisu', and this is the best i've 
	ever tried here in vancouver.I really suggest this restaurant to everyone who love Italian food, this 
	is the best you can find in vancouver.</p>
